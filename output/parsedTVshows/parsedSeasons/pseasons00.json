The 10-episode season follows Stonebridge (Philip Winchester) and Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) as they criss-cross the globe on the trail of a deadly international terrorist named Latif, who is planning a major attack involving a cache of WMD that could have global repercussions. Within the season-long arc involving the search for Latif (code-named \"Project Dawn\"), five separate adventures will be presented, each played out over two episodes. Sexy, suspenseful and action-packed, the series is set in exotic locations and has an abundance of twists and turns, as the two protagonists venture into New Delhi, Cape Town, Darfur and beyond to thwart the bad intentions of terrorists intent on bringing anarchy and destruction to our planet.",

His discovery attracts the attention of renowned surgeon Sir William Chester (Samuel West) and Her Majesty's Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel (Tom Ward), who task him to solve the case as quickly and quietly as possible so it won't derail their political agenda. As Inspector Marlott delves more deeply into the mystery of the patchwork corpse, he finds that he may have uncovered a secret best left alone.
