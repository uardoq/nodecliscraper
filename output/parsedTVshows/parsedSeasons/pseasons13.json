The gang even gets mixed up with the mob and the only way out is for Dennis to become a male escort. Maybe such outlandish behaviour is simply in their genes. After all, Frank (Danny DeVito), the father of Dee and Dennis, is totally out of control and has a \"gang\" of his own, the Yellow Jacket Boys (played by the doo-wop group the Mighty Echoes). And the dear old dad of Mac is no better. He's an ex-con and has his eye on Dee, who's definitely not interested. She dates a mentally challenged rapper instead. Dee also tries out for the professional football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, as does Mac, Dennis and Doyle McPoyle (Bob Rusch), reigniting the gang's feud with the inbred Doyle and his equally creepy brothers Liam and Ryan (Jimmi Simpson and Nate Mooney). Later on, the McPoyles invade Paddy's and it escalates into a hostage situation. The seriescloses with Charlie (Charlie Day) inadvertently putting the bar up as the grand prize in a dance marathon.",
