After accepting a coaching job at Austin's Texas Methodist University, Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) struggles to adapt  to his new team as well as life away from his family. The adjustment proves equally difficult for Tami Taylor (Connie Britton), who gives birth to a second daughter and battles loneliness during her maternity leave. To help out around the house, Tami's free-spirited sister, Shelley (Jessalyn Gilsig), briefly moves in with the family. Julie (Aimee Teegarden) offers her mom little comfort, however, as she taps into her wild side, frequently defying Tami and pursuing a relationship with an older guy. The newly dumped Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford) has a lot more on his plate than just a broken heart, though, as he looks for ways to care for his grandmother (Louanne Stephens), who suffers from dementia, and eventually hires live-in nurse Carlotta Alonso (Daniella Alonso). Matt's best friend, Landry Clarke (Jesse Plemmons), faces his own crisis after he kills a man who attacks Tyra Collette (Adrianne Palicki) and he and Tyra decide to cover it up. Jason Street (Scott Porter) also flirts with danger when he considers undergoing a risky---and illegal---surgery to reverse his paralysis. Worried about his friend, Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch) takes steps to repair their damaged relationship and prevent Street from taking unnecessary risks. Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly) also weighs in on Street's plans but mostly keeps busy with her church as she tries to distance herself from both Riggins and Street. Meanwhile, Brian \"Smash\" Williams (Gaius Charles) explores his college options as he begins the official recruitment process.",

New Panthers coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) arrives in Dillon amid soaring expectations and media scrutiny. It is clear that his coaching performance directly affects his welcome in the community, along with the acceptance of his wife, Tami (Connie Britton), and his daughter, Julie (Aimee Teegarden). Though Tami doesn't share her husband's passion for football, she is supportive nonetheless, and soon finds her own niche when she takes a job as the high school's guidance counselor. Julie, on the other hand, refuses to be friends with football players and doesn't like her new home in Dillon. The town's most beloved player is all-star quarterback Jason Street (Scott Porter), who suffers a spinal injury in the pilot episode that leaves him in a wheelchair. His paralysis profoundly affects those close to him, especially his girlfriend, Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly). The good-natured cheerleader channels her grief by entering a secret and volatile relationship with Street's charming-but-troubled best friend, Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch). Shy second-string quarterback Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford) is thrust into the role of starter after spending much of his football career on the bench and under the radar of the fans and even his teammates. Cocky running back Brian \"Smash\" Williams (Gaius Charles), meanwhile, revels in the spotlight and keeps his focus determinedly set on gaining an athletic scholarship to college. Also looking to the future is the beautiful and jaded Tyra Collette (Adrianne Palicki), who desperately wants to escape the small-town life that has consumed her mother and sister.",

It seems as though a skilled hacker has found a way to override communications on Air Force One, but who does he work for and how much further will he go? When strange things start happening at the McCord house, Elizabeth and Henry (Tim Daly) grow concerned that someone is stalking her family. The Defense Intelligence Agency asks Henry to recruit one of his Russian students to work for the U.S. government, but it will take a lot of persuading to accomplish. Stevie's (Wallis Currie-Wood) relationship with the president's son continues, but she begins to question their future. Elizabeth gets on board with the president's campaign for re-election, but her political views may cost him votes. Executive Producer Morgan Freeman directs and guest stars in the first episode of the season.",

While the president values Elizabeth's frankness and how she confidently handles foreign policy on her own terms, those qualities aren't always appreciated, especially by other members of the White House staff. Time and again proving herself capable of pulling off tricky feats of international diplomacy, perhaps the greatest difficulty faced by Elizabeth in Season 1 is getting to the bottom of the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of her predecessor. Elizabeth also deals with domestic challenges as she and her loving husband, theology scholar Henry McCord (Tim Daly), help their three children adjust to mom's demanding career. Rounding out the cast are Bebe Neuwirth and Željko Ivanek as Elizabeth's and the president's respective chiefs of staff.",
