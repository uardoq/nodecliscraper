Inasmuch as the kid is studying William Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\", he soon dreams up a wild scenario wherein all of the Moonlighting characters are recast as the principals in that boisterous battle-of-the-sexes comedy. What follows is an insane blend of faux Elizabethan dialogue and contemporary wisecracks (\"Doth bears bear-eth? Doth bees be-eth?\"), with a few \"improvements\" that the Bard of Avon would never have dreamed of--such as the swaggering Petruchio, aka David (Bruce Willis), escorting a bound-and-gagged Katherina, aka Maddie (Cybill Shepherd), to the altar! And since when did \"Taming of the Shrew\" include a sight gag straight out of the Warner Bros. cartoons, complete with a musical passage from composer Raymond Scott's \"Powerhouse\"? The episode's flippant credit title \"from an idea by William 'Bud' Shakespeare\" was obviously inspired by the infamous credit on the 1929 film version of Taming of the Shrew: \"Based on the play by William Shakespeare, with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor.\"",
