Bill, who lives in a suburb of Salt Lake City, UT, owns Henrickson's Home Plus, a successful retail store that is about to open its second branch. Bill is having problems performing sexually, and blames it on the stress. Having three wives vying for his attention probably doesn't help. Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) is insecure, and needs frequent reassurance from Bill. She seems lost when he is with his other wives. Nicki (Chlo√´ Sevigny) appears to be doing a lot of surreptitious luxury shopping, and often asks her husband for extra money. Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is the only wife who has a job. She works as a substitute teacher, part-time, and balks when Bill asks her to put her paycheck into the family pot. Bill searches for a solution to his impotence on the Internet. More trouble rears its head when his sister-in-law, Wanda (Melora Walters), calls to tell him that his father, Frank (Bruce Dern), is apparently gravely ill, and that his mother, Lois (Grace Zabriskie) refuses to take Frank to a doctor. Bill, who has not seen his family in a while, wants his brother Joey (Shawn Doyle) to handle it, but Wanda points out that calling Bill was a last resort. Bill convinces Barb to accompany him and Nicki to attend to his parents at the hated UEB compound at Juniper Creek, run by Nicki's father, Roman (Harry Dean Stanton). While Bill is on the compound, Roman confronts him about a business dispute. Meanwhile, Heather (Tina Majorino), a new girl at Sarah's (Amanda Seyfried) fast-food job and a devout Mormon, takes an interest in Sarah. The pilot was directed by Rodrigo Garc√≠a (Nine Lives).",

Margene overhears and is horrified, leading to increasing tension between the three wives. Margene also tells Bill that she needs her own car. Bill lets Roman (Harry Dean Stanton) know that he doesn't feel their old loan agreement extends to his newly opened second store. Roman clearly sees Bill's success as part of his own personal empire, and Bill is worried that the dangerous old man might take some kind of drastic action, so he hires a security consultant to install an alarm system in his three connected houses. Bill goes to drive Frank (Bruce Dern) home from the hospital, and Frank realizes that Bill suspects that it was Lois (Grace Zabriskie) who poisoned him. Ben's (Douglas Smith) non-Mormon girlfriend, Brynn (Sarah Jones), seems eager to get physically intimate with him, and he struggles against his natural desires. Heather (Tina Majorino) makes it clear to Sarah (Amanda Seyfried) that she knows about her parents' polygamous lifestyle, and still wants to be friends with her. \"I should tell you,\" Heather warns her, \"I don't agree with polygamy.\" \"Yeah, well,\" Sarah responds, \"Neither do I.\" Seyfried, Majorino, and Kyle Gallner, who plays Jason Embry, all also had recurring roles on Veronica Mars.",

Bill is upset when he finds out she plans to invite 153 people to a fancy hotel, and he's even angrier when she tells him that Roman (Harry Dean Stanton) has agreed to pay for the event. Bill insists that the party be a small event in their home, and lets her know that her father is not welcome. The security system he's installed to protect the family from Roman causes its own problems. Margene is excited about the prospect of meeting her mother-in-law, Lois (Grace Zabriskie), for the first time, but Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn) warns her not to get her hopes up. Someone, probably Alby (Matt Ross), barges into the offices of Henrickson Home Plus, and forces Wendy (Jodie Markell), a junior executive, to sign over a check for 20,000 dollars that Roman feels he's owed. Bill's partner, Don (Joel McKinnon Miller), expresses his concerns that their connection to Roman and the notorious Juniper Creek leaves them vulnerable to being exposed as polygamists, which would, among other things, destroy their business. Friendly new neighbors, Carl (Carlos Jacott) and Pam (Audrey Wasilewski), move in across the street from the Henricksons, and this is also cause for concern. On the day of the birthday party, cultures clash, as Roman shows up after all, and brings along young Rhonda (Daveigh Chase), who explains to Sarah (Amanda Seyfried) that she's in \"pre-marriage placement\" with Roman, a way to \"get around the law\" until she's 16. When Sarah asks about Rhonda's personal happiness, the girl tells her, \"The greatest freedom we have is obedience.\"",

No, she's not motivated by vanity, but rather curiosity: The artist had never met Maddie, but was clearly infatuated by her--and shortly after completing the painting, he committed suidice. Or did he? One thing is certain: There are several unsavory-looking characters who'd love to get their hands on the mysterious portrait. Highlights of the this episode include the Bernard Herrmann-esque musical score, a wry comment by David (Bruce Willis) about the series' writing staff, and a climactic (and very messy) set-to in an auto-painting shop.",

The only asset she has left is the ramshackle Blue Moon Detective Agency, manned by acerbic David Addison (Bruce Willis). Maddie takes an immediate dislike to David, while he considers her a sexual conquest-to-be. The twosome continues to bicker their way through their first case, pausing for amenities only when it appears that both of them are about to be bumped off. Once safely back in the office, their verbal guerilla warfare resumes, leading the viewer to expect marvelous things from the subsequent Moonlighting TV series. Little of the series' fabled self-consciousness (talking directly to the audience, making references to the quality of the scriptwriting, etc.) surfaces in the Moonlighting pilot, but the film works well despite this \"drawback.\" The series itself aired until May of 1989.",
