The Mayor of Television (John Ennis) himself comes out on-stage to cut a ceremonial ribbon, proclaiming, \"Here's to future nostalgia.\" This episode documents a feud between East Coast and West Coast ventriloquists, which, reminiscent of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, has become violent. There's also \"The DeLongpre Dannon Show,\" a talk show on which one guest (Bob) thinks he's a pregnant teenager, and another (David) thinks he's a seven-foot-tall psychiatrist. It turns out David's character also thinks he's an irate audience member, as he runs into the audience to offer his opinion -- \"Fake girl, you oughtta be able to have your imaginary baby!\" In another sketch, Bob and David play Sam and Criminy Craffft, (obviously based on H.R. Pufnstuf creators Sid and Marty Krofft) two former hippies responsible for creating children's television programs in the early '70s. They show a clip from the unaired show that got them fired, which takes place in \"The Altered State of Druggachusettes.\" This hilarious parody features David as Billy, a British-accented boy with a talking bong, who is lost in a candy-colored world of talking pills and potheads. Tom Kinney does a Charles Nelson Reilly impression as Professor L.S.D. Trails, who tries to help Billy and his friends (including a giant talking tab of acid named \"Hallucino-Jenny\") order a pizza.",

There's also a documentary about \"The Fab 3,\" three mop-topped British guys in the early '60s whose photographs make them a pop phenomenon, although they play no music. They travel to America, and there's a press conference where one of them, Larry (Cross), says, \"We've been photographed more than Jesus Christ.\" \"Everyone agreed that this was true,\" the solemn narrator recounts, \"and the group was shocked at the lack of controversy it sparked.\" Later in the show, Panzic Poojaran (Cross), a man enduring a hunger strike for political reasons, holds a press conference, during which he dazedly states, \"I want the world to know...that I am so hungry.\" If he dies, he says he wants his people to know, \"Bury me in mashed potatoes.\" The show closes with a clip from the annual Doomsday Telethon. Thirty million dollars must be raised each year in order to stop Dr. X (Odenkirk), a bald mad scientist with a German accent, from blowing up the earth with his \"doomsday laser.\" A comic (Tom Kinney) who makes kooky sound effects like Charlie Callas appears as a guest, and says of the doctor, \"This man is one great evil madman.\" The young \"poster boy\" for the Doomsday Telethon also comes on the show.

There are a few scenes of what such a future would look like, including a group of young people wearing pastel sweaters, golf pants, and porkpie hats, and calling each other \"dear.\" Then there's a sketch wherein Chris (Bob) and Tracy (Brett Paesal) find out that they're both having an affair with the same guy, Lee (David). Not only that, Lee is seeing the entire family, including their teenage daughter, her boyfriend, and Nana McCrudden. They're all heartbroken when Lee breaks up with them, confessing, \"I'm seeing another family.\" This episode also features the beloved \"Blowing Up the Moon\" sketch, in which NASA announces that they finally have the technology to do it. This causes a national excitement, with celebrations planned, and a patriotic pop song about blowing up the moon hitting the charts. The high spirits are dampened when Galileo, the chimpanzee assigned to fly the explosives to the moon, uses sign language to ask one of the scientists, \"Why?\" Later, clips are shown from a misbegotten 1970s movie about streaking, \"Bare Ambition.\" Jimmy (Bob) is an ambitious streaker who runs into trouble when he meets Coco Robbins (David), a streaking superstar.

Odenkirk catches the show while grocery shopping, and storms back, outraged. \"I go to the store to get some eggs and you let this guy take over?\" he chastises Cross. Cross calls Kedsie \"hilarious,\" and fires Odenkirk. Then he fires himself. When Odenkirk protests that he's funnier than Kedsie, Cross points out that Kedsie makes more money, which leads into a sketch about \"the Worthington Law,\" which is \"More money = Better than.\" As explained by Carl Espick of Value Magazine, this means that Darryl Strawberry is a better person than St. Francis of Assisi. There's also a sketch about a successful executive, Ted (Odenkirk), whose former Siamese twin, Ned (Cross), wants them to be surgically reattached, because things aren't working out for him. There are flashbacks of Ted playing quarterback at school while Ned smokes pot, and of Ted returning home from combat attached to antiwar protester Ned. Later, in a skit parodying Amadeus, Cross plays Salini, a mediocre composer of marching band music who is tormented by the brilliance of idiot-savant marching music genius John Baptiste Philouza (Odenkirk). Salini responds to Philouza's tuneless humming, saying his \"music revealed a world of unimaginable beauty. Was this God and the angels conversing? Or was it the Devil?
