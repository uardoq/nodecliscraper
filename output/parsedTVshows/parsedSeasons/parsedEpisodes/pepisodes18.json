In addition to these two, single mother and Las Vegas stripper Niki Sanders (Ali Larter) finds a duel personality with incredible strength emerging, high school cheerleader Claire Bennett (Hayden Panettiere) is shocked to discover that she can walk away from most any physical trauma completely unharmed, and heroin-addicted artist Isaac Mendez (Santiago Cabrera)'s paintings begin taking on a prophetic - and frighteningly apocalyptic - tone. Meanwhile, in India, university professor Mohinder Suresh (Sendil Ramamurthy) is compelled to continue to extraordinary research his father was conducting at the time he was mysteriously murdered - research that could ultimately provide an explanation for the inexplicable proliferation of powers while bringing all of the gifted individuals together to fight a common cause. But someone doesn't seem to want these powerful individuals to pool their remarkable resources, and it appears that they're willing to resort to murder in order to prevent that from happening.",
