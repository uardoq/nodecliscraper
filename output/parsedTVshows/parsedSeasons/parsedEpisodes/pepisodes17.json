The explanation is more \"logical\" than one might expect from a Twilight Zone episode, but that may be because this was the pilot show, and the producers wanted to \"sell\" the property to sponsors who might otherwise be skeptical about a weekly sci-fi/fantasy anthology.

The reason behind the children's animosity becomes clear when the Enterprise crew members discover that they have also been affected by the plague, which prolongs childhood to hundreds of years but brings death to anyone past puberty. Indeed, Kirk himself has contracted the disease and must somehow find a cure -- a quest that becomes all the more difficult when he and Miri, who has also begun to show symptoms, are held captive by a violent gang of children.",
