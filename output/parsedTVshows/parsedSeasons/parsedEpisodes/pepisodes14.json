After commandeering a miraculous escape from the said death penitentiary, Vrba and Wetzler prepared a 32-page document known as the Vrba-Wetzler Report and promptly delivered it to Allied officials - thereby saving the lives of countless potential victims. In the process, however, Hungarian ruler Miklós Horthy deliberately withheld this information from his countrymen for a lengthy period. To no one's surprise, this stirred up massive degrees of controversy and dissent.

One, for instance, has its skull dismembered and placed beneath its feet; another bears enormous iron shackles clamped around its ankles; 28 additional skeletons all present displays of violent, sadistic death and torture. This discovery naturally raises a myriad of questions about the origin of the bodies, the historical atrocities that may lie behind the cadavers, and the identity of the buried individuals per se .
