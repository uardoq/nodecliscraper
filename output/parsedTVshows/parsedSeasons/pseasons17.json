Her producer's gig gone, Reagan assumes more duties at home, while Chris ventures into a business with her new-to-town divorced brother Scott (Luka Jones). Getting out of the house, the couple help Ava ease into life off-camera in a memorable night on the town with Chris's obnoxious college roommate Jerry (Rob Huebel); and they join Scott for a \"family funlympics\" in the mountains with neighbors Gene (Matt Braunger) and Terry (Jean Villepique).

As a producer for the talk show \"Ava\" (hosted by SNL alum Maya Rudolph), Reagan's crazy hours force ex-lawyer Chris into the Mr. Mom role, while the pair helplessly try to maintain normalcy in the bedroom and with friends and overbearing relatives. When not changing diapers, Chris bounces ideas off neighbor Reed (Will Forte), while he and Reagan go overboard to befriend a really \"fun\" couple (Nat Faxon and Ben Falcone) who move in nearby. Alanis Morissette and Stevie Nicks (as Reagan and Ava's dream guest) make Season 1 cameos.",

As she helps protect them (or is she?) by collecting intel on Pastor Tim (Kelly AuCoin) and his wife Alice (Suzy Jane Hunt), she grows closer to her mom Elizabeth (Keri Russell), who is teaching her self-defense. Meanwhile, Elizabeth and Philip (Matthew Rhys) investigate an American plot to create famine in the Soviet Union, and Elizabeth comes to terms with a difficult decision after a mission goes awry. Elsewhere, Oleg (Costa Ronin) struggles with his loyalty to the KGB; and as the FBI continue to seek out the Soviet agents, Stan (Noah Emmerich) struggles with the loss of Nina (Annet Mahendru) and the consequences of his choices.",

Jones, whose only career loss prior to the season was through disqualification in the Season 10 finale of \"TUF,\" served as coach to seven up-and-coming middleweights opposed by the seven fighters mentored by journeyman Chael Sonnen. Adding intrigue to the weekly elimination bouts were $25,000 incentives from UFC president Dana White for the season's top knockout, submission and fight. The ultimate prize, of course, was the Ultimate Fighter crown and its six-figure UFC contract, which seemed destined to land with hard-hitting Jamaican Uriah Hall as the season developed. Hall was the top talent on Team Sonnen, while Dylan Andrews emerged as the feel-good story for Team Jones after defeating the top pick from the schoolyard-style selection of teams at season's start. Blood was spilled in a satisfying Las Vegas finale, which included a female fight to determine one of the coaches for the first co-ed season of The Ultimate Fighter.",
