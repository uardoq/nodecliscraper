Upon her return to the hospital, Jackie is back at square one under the Diversion Program and isn't allowed to touch patients or medication, and must undergo daily urine screens. Meanwhile, Coop (Peter Facinelli) prepares for his last day at All Saints and is replaced by Dr. Bernard Prince (Tony Shalhoub), who surprises everyone with his carpe diem attitude.

If that isn't enough to send Jackie over the edge, she is shocked to learn that Kevin is getting married, and that Frank (Adam Ferrara), who is unaware she is using again, wants to move in with her.

As the season opens, the Henricksons are still reeling from publicity generated by the U.S. government's raid on the Juniper Creek compound, and worrying that Nikki's association with the now imprisoned Roman Grant (Harry Dean Stanton) will reveal their closely guarded secret. Their exclusion from a neighborhood block party seems to confirm their fears, and only the quick thinking of Nikki (Chloë Sevigny) at the event saves them from disaster. However, Nikki has secrets of her own. She's working at the DA's office under Margene's name to find out information about Roman's upcoming trial. And she's letting the family think she's having fertility issues while secretly taking the pill. Both deceptions place her marriage to Bill (Bill Paxton) in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Sarah (Amanda Seyfried) hides her pregnancy and makes plans to get away from her family after learning they're considering taking on Ana (Branka Katic) as a fourth wife. But Sarah's condition is not something she's able to hide for long. Meanwhile, \"boss lady\" Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn) has troubles of her own. After enduring a cancer scare, she must defend herself in front of a Mormon disciplinary council for her polygamous lifestyle---but not before undergoing a sacred Mormon ceremony shown in a controversial episode. Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) shows her independent side and begins a new business venture. Tragedy strikes for Bill's brother Joey (Shawn Doyle) and his already troubled family. As for the Henrickson patriarch, Bill finds his efforts to launch the casino continually thwarted. But soon a new opportunity shows itself.

As a mortified Barb withdraws from her first-wife responsibilities to privately reexamine her place in a plural marriage, Bill (Bill Paxton) is determined to learn who betrayed the Henricksons. He also begins looking for a way to secure his family's financial well-being by pursuing an electronic-gambling enterprise. Although such a vice-ridden industry goes against his core beliefs, Bill takes a risk, believing the acquisition can be used as leverage in a battle between father-in-law Roman Grant (Harry Dean Stanton) and an even more outlaw polygamous sect led by the diabolical Hollis Greene (Luke Askew). Meanwhile, the Juniper Creek compound is awash in rumors of foul play and a struggle for power after the poisoning of Roman's son Alby (Matt Ross). Evidence points to Wanda (Melora Walters), the unstable wife of Bill's brother Joey (Shawn Doyle), as the culprit. In another scandal, Roman's teenage bride-to-be Rhonda (Daveigh Chase) flees Juniper Creek to hide with Bill's family, though her flight seems less in protest of her impending marriage to the elderly prophet than a clumsy, ill-advised publicity stunt. Also at the Henricksons, Bill and Barb's oldest child Sarah (Amanda Seyfried) grows disillusioned with her three-household home and strikes up an illicit romance with Scott (Aaron Paul), a man 10 years her senior. Meanwhile, Sarah's brother Ben (Douglas Smith) gives serious consideration to following in his father's conjugal footsteps. And those are certainly big shoes to fill as Bill mulls adding a fourth wife after he meets a waitress named Ana (Branka Katic). The idea is as aggressively championed by third wife Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) as it is vehemently opposed by Barb and second wife Nicki (Chloë Sevigny).",

They're the typical suburban American family, occupied with hectic schedules and bills to pay, as well as trying to make sense of an increasingly complicated world. Oh, and they also happen to be polygamists. In the first season of this unconventional, critically acclaimed drama, every day is a new adventure for patriarch Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton), who lives outside Salt Lake City with his three wives---Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn), Nicki (Chloë Sevigny) and Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin)---and their collective brood of seven children, including Bill and Barb's teenagers, Ben (Douglas Smith) and Sarah (Amanda Seyfried). Owner of a profitable home-improvement superstore, Bill is anxious to expand his empire (and support his growing family) by opening another Home Plus location with his business partner and fellow polygamist, Don Embry (Joel McKinnon Miller). However, an unwanted investor hoping to share in Bill's good fortune emerges: Roman Grant (Harry Dean Stanton), the scheming \"Prophet\" of the remote Juniper Creek polygamist compound who is also Nicki's father. There's been bad blood between Bill and Roman ever since the former was expelled from Juniper Creek as an adolescent, largely by the latter's hand. Bill also clashes with Adaleen (Mary Kay Place), one of Roman's wives, and their power-hungry son and chief enforcer, Alby (Matt Ross). But Bill is not alone in this feud, as his father Frank (Bruce Dern), mother Lois (Grace Zabriskie) and brother Joey (Shawn Doyle) still live at Juniper Creek and identify, to varying degrees of familial allegiance, with Bill's enmity for Roman. On the home front, third wife Margene risks exposing the Henricksons' illicit lifestyle by befriending a Mormon neighbor; Nicki tries to hide a shopping addiction and the tens of thousands of dollars of credit-card debt that goes with it; and Barb tiptoes into the spotlight after one of her kids nominates her for Utah's Mother of the Year award.",

Season 1, hosted by Andy Cohen, brings a few changes, but the core is the same. Each episode features a single man or woman looking for romance and three potential love interests. After three blind dates, the guest and the audience must pick one of the contestants for an additional overnight date. If they pick the same contestant, the guest wins $10,000 and gets to go on the date; otherwise, the guest must choose one of the two people, but gets the $10,000 only if they go with the audience's pick.",
