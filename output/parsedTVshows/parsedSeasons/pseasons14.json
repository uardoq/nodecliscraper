Forever living in his more successful brother's shadow, Ray is a balding ad pot-bellied parole officer with a huge chip on his shoulder about the hand he's been dealt -- and he blames his brother.

Along the way, a mysterious woman with a Kappa past is visited, the search for the killer, now called the Red Devil is mounted, and Dean Munsch (Jamie Leigh Curtis), never a proponent of the vixens of Kappa House, struggles to keep the university open. Later, the Kappas try using a Ouija board to find out who the Red Devil killer is, which actually triggers beyond-the-grave contact with a late member of the sorority who has a dire warning for her sisters. Eventually, startling confessions lead to the unmasking of the Red Devil and the identity of the killer.",

Due to coincidence and some possibly incriminating evidence involving the lad's mother, Jess (Natalie Martinez), Ben becomes the prime suspect, and he and his wife, Christy (KaDee Strickland), and two daughters, Natalie (Indiana Evans) and Abby (Belle Shouse), are engulfed in a media firestorm while he is doggedly pursued by the no-nonsense Det. Andrea Cornell (Juliette Lewis). Despite having no recollection of the night Tom was killed, thanks to a night on the town with his tenant and best friend, Dave (Dan Fogler), Ben goes to extremes to prove his innocence, though it could cost him his family, his freedom and maybe even his life. Guest stars include Melissa Gilbert, Michael Beach, Denise Dowes, Greg Alan Williams and Meaghan Rath.",

Night Shyamalan begins with U.S. Secret Service agent Ethan Burke (Matt Dillon) awakening from a car accident trapped in the seemingly idyllic, but secretly insidious, town of Wayward Pines, Idaho. It soon becomes clear that this peculiar Northwest hamlet is quite literally impossible to leave. The phones don't make outgoing calls, it's surrounded by an electric fence and the residents are under constant camera surveillance. Nobody is supposed to talk about the past or question the present. And anyone who tries to escape is punished via a public execution called a reckoning. With a history of mental illness and hallucinations, Ethan begins to question his own sanity as he investigates this tight-knit community, which includes fellow agent and former lover Kate Hewson (Carla Gugino), who has developed the façade of a Stepford spouse in order to ensure her survival. Before long, Ethan is reunited with his wife Theresa (Shannyn Sossamon) and son Ben (Charlie Tahan), but now they too are now stuck in this place where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted. Rounding out the cast are Melissa Leo, Juliette Lewis, Toby Jones and Terrence Howard.",
