There is also the matter of Claudia (Allison Scagliotti) dealing with the revelation that Claire (Chryssie Whitehead), the sister she thought had died in a car crash, is actually alive, but not well as she lies in an artifact-induced coma. While trying to save Claudia's sibling, Benedict Valda (Mark Sheppard) resurfaces and plots to move the Warehouse to China. The series also includes cases that take the agents to Washington, D.C., a Renaissance Faire, and inside a telenovela, at which point Pete (Eddie McClintock) starts to acknowledge his feelings for Myka (Joanne Kelly).",
